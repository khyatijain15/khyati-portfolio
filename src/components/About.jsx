      <p>
        I'm a final-year Computer Science Engineering student with a strong foundation in frontend development and a passion for UI/UX design. Iâ€™ve worked on real-world projects including institutional websites and hackathon-winning UI designs. I specialize in translating user needs into intuitive, accessible, and engaging web interfaces using React, Tailwind, and Figma.
